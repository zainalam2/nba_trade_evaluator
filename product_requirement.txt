# NBA ML Trade Evaluation & Single-Agent AI Trade Advisor Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the requirements for developing a unified system that evaluates NBA trades using machine learning (ML) and provides advisory suggestions through a single, integrated AI agent. The system will combine trade evaluation (via ML model outputs) with natural-language advisory capabilities, all accessible through an interactive API. This streamlined approach simplifies development, eases debugging, and provides an excellent entry point for exploring agentic AI concepts.

## 2. Project Goals

- **Trade Evaluation**:  
  Develop an ML model that:
  - Predicts the fairness of NBA trades using both classification (e.g., fair vs. unfair) and regression (estimating win impact).
  - Estimates the overall impact on a team based on engineered features.

- **Trade Advisory**:  
  Build a single AI agent that:
  - Integrates the trade proposal details with the ML model’s predictions.
  - Generates a natural-language explanation and provides actionable suggestions for improvement.
  
- **Deployment**:  
  Package the system as an interactive API so users can submit trade proposals and receive both quantitative evaluations and qualitative advice.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope
- **ML Trade Evaluation Module**:
  - Data collection, cleaning, and feature engineering.
  - Model training (classification and regression) and validation.
  - Development of an interface to return trade evaluation metrics.
  
- **Single Agent AI Trade Advisor**:
  - Design and integration of a prompt template that merges trade details with ML outputs.
  - Implementation of a large language model (LLM)–based advisor (e.g., using GPT‑4) to generate analysis and recommendations.
  
- **API & Deployment**:
  - Development of a REST API (e.g., using FastAPI) to handle user inputs.
  - Setup of CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and model monitoring.
  - Provision of documentation and, optionally, a simple web UI for demonstration.

### Out of Scope
- Development of a multi-agent system.
- Production-level UI/UX design beyond a simple demonstration interface.
- Extensive post-deployment scaling beyond initial prototyping.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### 4.1. ML Trade Evaluation Module

- **Data Processing & Feature Engineering**:
  - **Data Sources**: Collect NBA player statistics, team performance data, trade histories, and salary cap information.
  - **Feature Engineering**: Create custom metrics (e.g., Player Impact Score, Salary Efficiency, Win Share Contribution).

- **Model Training**:
  - **Classification Model**: Train a model to classify trades as fair or unfair.
  - **Regression Model**: Train a model to predict the win impact of trades.
  - **Optional Enhancement**: Integrate vector search techniques (using FAISS or Pinecone) to retrieve context from similar past trades.

- **Model Interface**:
  - Develop a function that accepts a trade proposal and outputs:
    - Fairness rating.
    - Predicted win impact.
    - Contextual information from similar trades.

### 4.2. Single Agent AI Trade Advisor

- **Integrated Prompt Design**:
  - Develop a prompt template that combines trade proposal details with ML model outputs.  
    *Example Prompt*:  
    "Based on the provided trade proposal and the predicted fairness score of X and win impact of Y, please analyze this trade and suggest improvements considering historical trends in similar trades."

- **LLM-Based Advisor**:
  - Leverage a large language model (e.g., GPT‑4) to process the combined input and generate:
    - A coherent natural-language analysis.
    - Actionable recommendations.
  - Implement chain-of-thought reasoning internally to justify the outputs.

### 4.3. API & MLOps Deployment

- **API Development**:
  - Create a RESTful API (using FastAPI) that:
    - Accepts trade proposals as input.
    - Calls the ML module to obtain evaluation metrics.
    - Forwards the combined output to the single-agent advisor.
    - Returns the final evaluation and advice to the user.

- **Deployment Pipeline**:
  - Establish automated testing routines.
  - Set up CI/CD (using GitHub Actions or similar).
  - Implement model monitoring with tools like MLflow, Prometheus, or AWS CloudWatch.

- **Documentation & User Interface**:
  - Prepare comprehensive documentation for developers and end users.
  - Optionally build a simple web interface (using Streamlit or React) for system demonstration.

## 5. Non-functional Requirements

- **Performance**:  
  The system should provide timely responses suitable for an interactive API, ensuring acceptable latency for real-time trade evaluations.

- **Scalability**:  
  The architecture should be modular to support scaling, including future decomposition into multiple agents if needed.

- **Maintainability**:  
  Code should follow modular design principles to simplify future updates, debugging, and enhancements.

- **Reliability**:  
  The system must ensure consistent and accurate outputs with robust error handling and monitoring.

- **Security**:  
  Adhere to industry-standard security practices in data handling and API access.

- **Usability**:  
  Both the API and any user interfaces should be user-friendly and well-documented.

## 8. Benefits of the Single-Agent Approach

- **Simpler Development**:  
  Fewer components result in less complexity and easier debugging.

- **Faster Prototyping**:  
  Rapid iteration is facilitated by avoiding the need for inter-agent communication or orchestration.

- **Easier Learning Curve**:  
  Focusing on a single agent allows a deeper understanding of agentic AI before considering a multi-agent system.

- **Scalability on Demand**:  
  Once the single-agent system is stable, it can be modularized into specialized agents if project requirements grow.

## 9. Final Workflow Example

1. **Input**:  
   The user submits a trade proposal through the API.

2. **ML Evaluation**:  
   The ML module processes the proposal and outputs:
   - Fairness score.
   - Predicted win impact.
   - Similar trade context (if available).

3. **Agent Advisory**:  
   The single AI agent receives the combined input (trade details + ML outputs) and generates:
   - A natural-language analysis.
   - Suggestions for trade improvements.

4. **Output**:  
   The API returns the trade evaluation and advice to the user.
